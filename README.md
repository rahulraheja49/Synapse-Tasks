Sentiment analysis: To obtain tweets from Twitter API and analyse it to be positive or negative.
Further filters can be added depending on the output required.

Text similarity: To check how similar two texts are by using tokenization and cosine similarity.
Note: Here, I have used tokenization but not stemming or lemmatization. To get better output, we can use a module like wordnet so that even meanings are compared.

Data cleaning and visualization: The data given was in json. I used the 'json' module to obtain the data. I then generated a simple counting algorithm. The values from the above algorithm are then plotted using the 'matplotlib' module. I have plotted pie and bar graphs for the values.
