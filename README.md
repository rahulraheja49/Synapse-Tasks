Sentiment analysis: To obtain tweets from Twitter API and analyse it to be positive or negative.
Further filters can be added depending on the output required.

Text similarity: To check how similar two texts are by using tokenization and cosine similarity.
Note: Here, I have used tokenization but not stemming or lemmatization. To get better output, we can use a module like wordnet so that even meanings are compared.
