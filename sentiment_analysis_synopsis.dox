First, we start by getting the data from Twitter API.
To access Twitter API, we have to create a twitter developer account.
Data is collected using the python module tweepy.
On collecting the data, we can further derive specifics from it as it is in the form of objects.
Now, using the module textblob, we have a direct function "TextBlob" that performs sentiment analysis. This is done by first tokenizing the input string and then removing the words that have no value on the sentiment of a string.
The rest of the words are lemmatized and checked if they have a positive or negative impact on the statement.
Then, using the 'sentiment' function, we get the polarity and subjectivity of the sentence and you can use your own grading system further.
